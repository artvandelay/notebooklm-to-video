Create artistic podcast album art with a consistent signature style for our channel. Use:

VISUAL STYLE:
- Artistic and sophisticated design (think album covers, not thumbnails)
- Rich, deep colors with elegant gradients or textures
- Minimalist yet impactful composition
- Abstract or artistic interpretations rather than literal representations

SIGNATURE CHANNEL ELEMENTS:
- Subtle geometric patterns or abstract shapes as background elements
- Consistent color palette: deep blues, purples, or warm gradients
- Clean, modern typography if text is needed
- Professional podcast/audio aesthetic (think vinyl records, sound waves, or audio equipment as subtle design elements)

ARTISTIC FLAIR:
- Hand-drawn or painted aesthetic rather than photorealistic
- Artistic interpretation of concepts rather than literal imagery
- Focus on mood and atmosphere over explicit content representation
- Gallery-worthy artistic quality that could work as standalone art

The final result should be recognizable as part of our podcast series while being unique to each episode's content.
